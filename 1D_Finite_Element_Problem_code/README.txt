<^> INSTRUCTION FOR THE CODE <^>
By: Jorge Simón & Iñaki Fernandez Tena
Master In Space And Aeronautical Engineering
Computational Engineering Assigment  CSM Task 01
<^>==========================<^>


In this directory there are 7 codes:

1- main.m : Main code of the problem.
2- functions/body_force.m : function for the external b(x) force.
3- functions/error.m : function for computing the error
4- functions/gauss.m : function for Gauss quadrature points and weights (Appendix B).
5- functions/shape.m : function for Elements and shape functions (Appendix A).
6- functions/sigma_analytical.m : function for the analytical expression of sigma.
7- functions/u_analytical.m : function for the analytical expression of u.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE RUN ALL THE FUNCTIONS BEFORE RUNING THE main.m CODE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The results will be plotted after the compilation of the main.m code. Make sure that all the functions are stored in function/ directory. Also make sure to add to your path the functions/ directory or you can put all the functions in the same direcotry where main.m is stored.
