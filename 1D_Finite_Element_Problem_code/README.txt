<^> INSTRUCTION FOR THE CODE <^>
By: Jorge Simón & Iñaki Fernandez Tena

<^>==========================<^>


In this directory there are 7 codes:

1- main.m : Main code of the problem.
2- functions/body_force.m : function for the external b(x) force.
3- functions/error.m : function for computing the error
4- functions/gauss.m : function for Gauss quadrature points and weights (Appendix B).
5- functions/shape.m : function for Elements and shape functions (Appendix A).
6- functions/sigma_analytical.m : function for the analytical expression of sigma.
7- functions/u_analytical.m : function for the analytical expression of u.


The results will be plotted after the compilation of the main.m code. Make sure that all the functions are stored in function/ directory. Also make sure to add to your path the functions/ directory or you can put all the functions in the same direcotry where main.m is stored.
